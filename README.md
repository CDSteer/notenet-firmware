notenet-firmware
================

Firmware for Spark Core devices to interact with NoteNet.

The main focus of the project is ambient notification, too many notifications we receive today are intrusive and distracting. They often take us off task or take us out of our environment to looking down at screens and requiring too much of our attention to interpret simple information.

NoteNet will give you power over your notifications, it will make notifications part of your life, not something demanding you away from it.

## Set-Up

Code found in folder `src/` needs to be flashed to your Spark Core.

Then sign up for out pytotype website [NoteNet](http://nothing2play.com/NoteCube/) and add your device.

We currently have weather working, so check it out :)
